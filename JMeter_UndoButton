You can add Undo/Redo button to your JMeter.

You just need to go to jmeter.properties file(located in bin folder)
then search for undo.history.size.

Remove comment and make value like below:

undo.history.size=3

Here 3 is number of steps you can Undo/Redo your steps.

Do not exceed it to 5, your JMeter will get slow like anything.

Thank You!
